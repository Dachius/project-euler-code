# project-euler-code
Code for the problems on the website Project Euler. I do pay attention to the algorithmic complexity of my solutions, but many are bound to be inefficient, espeicially considering the abundance of problems with complicated linear time solutions derivable only through mathematical toil.

Each program runs in less than one minute on my machine, the recommended maximum time for execution prescribed by the project euler site.
